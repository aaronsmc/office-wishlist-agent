# Vercel KV Setup Guide

## Why Vercel KV?
Vercel KV is a Redis-compatible database service built into Vercel. It's perfect for storing your wishlist data with guaranteed cross-device persistence.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Enable Vercel KV in Your Project
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project (office-wishlist-agent)
3. Go to the "Storage" tab
4. Click "Create Database"
5. Choose "KV" (Key-Value)
6. Name it "wishlist-kv"
7. Click "Create"

### 2. Get Your KV URL
1. In your Vercel dashboard, go to Storage
2. Click on your KV database
3. Go to the "Settings" tab
4. Copy the "REST API URL" (starts with `https://`)
5. Copy the "REST API Token" (starts with `A...`)

### 3. Add Environment Variables
1. In your Vercel project dashboard
2. Go to "Settings" → "Environment Variables"
3. Add these variables:
   - `KV_REST_API_URL` = Your KV URL
   - `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` = Your KV Token

### 4. Deploy
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Vercel will automatically deploy
3. Your KV database will be connected

## Benefits
- ✅ **Built into Vercel** - No external services needed
- ✅ **Free tier** - 30,000 requests/month
- ✅ **Reliable** - Professional Redis infrastructure
- ✅ **Cross-device** - Works on all devices
- ✅ **Real-time** - Data updates immediately
- ✅ **Persistent** - Data never gets lost

## How It Works
1. **Submit wishlist** → Data saved to Vercel KV
2. **Open dashboard** → Data loaded from Vercel KV
3. **Different device** → Same data appears
4. **Delete/clear** → Changes saved to Vercel KV

## Testing
1. Deploy to Vercel
2. Submit a wishlist on one device
3. Open the dashboard on another device
4. Data should appear immediately

## Troubleshooting
- **KV not working?** Check environment variables are set
- **Data not persisting?** Verify KV database is created
- **API errors?** Check Vercel function logs

This solution is much simpler than external databases and will definitely work for cross-device data persistence!
