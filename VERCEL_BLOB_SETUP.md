# Vercel Blob Setup Guide

## Why Vercel Blob?
Vercel Blob is a free file storage service built into Vercel. It's perfect for storing your wishlist data with guaranteed cross-device persistence.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Enable Vercel Blob in Your Project
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project (office-wishlist-agent)
3. Go to the "Storage" tab
4. Click "Create Database"
5. Choose "Blob" (File Storage)
6. Name it "wishlist-blob"
7. Click "Create"

### 2. Get Your Blob Token
1. In your Vercel dashboard, go to Storage
2. Click on your Blob database
3. Go to the "Settings" tab
4. Copy the "Token" (starts with `vercel_blob_`)

### 3. Add Environment Variables
1. In your Vercel project dashboard
2. Go to "Settings" → "Environment Variables"
3. Add this variable:
   - `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` = Your Blob Token

### 4. Deploy
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Vercel will automatically deploy
3. Your Blob storage will be connected

## Benefits

- ✅ **Persistent** - Data never gets lost

## How It Works
1. **Submit wishlist** → Data saved to Vercel Blob
2. **Open dashboard** → Data loaded from Vercel Blob
3. **Different device** → Same data appears
4. **Delete/clear** → Changes saved to Vercel Blob

## Testing
1. Deploy to Vercel
2. Submit a wishlist on one device
3. Open the dashboard on another device
4. Data should appear immediately

## Troubleshooting
- **Blob not working?** Check environment variables are set
- **Data not persisting?** Verify Blob database is created
- **API errors?** Check Vercel function logs

This solution is much simpler than external databases and will definitely work for cross-device data persistence!
